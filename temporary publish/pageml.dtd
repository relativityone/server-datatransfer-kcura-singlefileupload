          This element contains information about the

          Text range information for a particular page is grouped into 
          categories corresponding to the typical organization of word 
          processing documents.

<!--ordinal: 
          Specifies the ordinal of the page, where the first page has 
          a value of 1.  This is separate from special page numbering 
          or renumbering that may be specified in the input document 
          (see the {@term name} attribute).
        -->
<!--name: 
          Specifies the page number as a string corresponding to the page 
          number information provided in the input document.  For word 
          processing documents it may not correspond to the {@term ordinal} 
          attribute in certain circumstances, such as when the input 
          document specifies a different starting page number.  For non word 
          processing documents the value of this attribute is taken from 
          the section name (i.e. for a spreadsheet, the page names would 
          be the same as the sheet names).
